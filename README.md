**Next Steps** 
Add A/B testing (commented sample code available) where:
- 50% of visitors see the weather (test group) 
- 50% see the normal page (control group)  
- Measures if weather displays lead to more visits (Conversion rate)

This solution helps the National Trust enhance visitor experience while gathering data to confirm if weather displays drive engagement.
